# study-notes

## Introduction
We used appjar as our library to make this study notes. 

## Features
You can put in images, write things and share your work with others with a fancy username.

The login page is to greet the person and the notebook is inside. 

## Problems
Due to the architecture of Appjar, the save button currently doesn't work. 
    - The appjar cannot recognise where you are
    - When we try to get the TXT file, appjar just loops it
Also, the packaging didn't work on MacOS due to appjar but it does operate. 
However, it does operate on Windows and Linux.
